# Getting Started:
POV is from an Admin view point

2. Once you're logged in, you will see sneaker cards and a button to add a new sneaker and delete a sneaker.
3. You can also click on a sneaker card header and view a detail page with more information on it.
4. After typing in to add a sneaker with a image uploaded it will redirect you to the feed page and have your new sneaker appear.
